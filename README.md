## ⚠️ Current Status  
✅ **Core Architecture Implemented**  
⚠️ **Node Connection Issues** *(Work in Progress)*  

> **Note**: This project demonstrates a functional design, but node linking in LangFlow is unstable. Debugging help is welcome!

---

## 📌 Features  
- **Food-related Q&A**: Answers queries like _"Is this dish gluten-free?"_  
- **LangFlow Pipeline**: Custom nodes for intent detection & response generation.  
- **Gemma 2B Backend**: Optional LLM integration (partially functional).  

---

## 🔧 Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-qa.git
cd restaurant-qa
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🛠 Usage  
1. **Start LangFlow**:  
   ```bash
   langflow run
   ```
2. **Access UI**: `http://localhost:5000`  
3. **Known Issues**:  
   - Nodes fail to connect intermittently (retry or manual JSON editing).  
   - Gemma 2B integration requires Ollama debugging.

## � Debugging Node Connections  
If nodes won't link:  
1. **Check Ports**: Ensure no conflicts with `5000`/`11434`.  
2. **Manual JSON Flow**:  
   ```python
   # In your flow.json:
   "nodes": [
     {
       "id": "node1",
       "connections": {"output": ["node2"]}  # ← Manual links
     }
   ]
   ```
3. **Logs**:  
   ```bash
   langflow --log-level debug
   ```

### Key Messaging Strategies:
1. **Problem Framing**:  
   - Use "Work in Progress" instead of "Broken"  
   - Position issues as opportunities for collaboration  

2. **Actionable Debugging Tips**:  
   - Provide specific workarounds (JSON editing, logs)  

3. **Visual Cues**:  
   - 🟢/🟡/🔴 status icons  
   - Separate "Known Issues" section  

4. **Call-to-Action**:  
   - Explicitly list needed contributions
